design patterns and Observer, MVC, and Abstract Factory.

Introduction
============
This project is divided into 7 assignments. Each assignment contributes
a component to the project as a whole. By the end of the semester you should
be able to setup a project using the CMake build system, manage the project
using Mercurial Distributed Version Control, and unit test it with GTest. 
This project will be managed as a Test Driven design. The Tests will be given
to you, and this will for the basis for your grade. 

Each week you will received a set of classes to make tests pass. Initially
the tests will be failing, once the code is complete the test cases will turn
green.  Green tests will received full credit.
