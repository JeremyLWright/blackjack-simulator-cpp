  \page assign3 Assignment 3 :: Hand Class
  
  In this project you will use the Card classes you built in project 3 to build a Hand. The Hand is used in the game to determine a winner. Tests will be provided for the assignment. With this base level of functionality, you can extend the hand to full out the semantics of the game.

Objectives
----------
- Build 1 class: Casino::Hand
- Enable the Hand Tests (tests/HandTest.cpp)
- Push to bitbucket.
- Turn in the tag URL on Blackboard 

Instructions
------------
-# Enable the Hand Tests by changing the code in HandTest.cpp (Figure 1) to look like Figure 2.
    -# These tests were disabled because the cause segmentation faults until Card is properly implemented.
-# All tests in the HandTest group should pass.
-# Commit, and Tag this as: Assignment3_vXX
