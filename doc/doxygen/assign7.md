\page assign7 Assignment 7 :: System Simulation

In this project you will leverage all the classes you've built up to now to simulate a blackjack game. Essentially, we'll allow the computer to play Blackjack against itself, to evaluate different betting strageties. One stragety we'll attempt to build is called the Perfect Stragety.
