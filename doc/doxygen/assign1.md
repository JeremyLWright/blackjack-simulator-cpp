\page assign1 Assignment 1 :: Unit Testing
  This project is about an agile concept called Red-Green Refactoring. Essentially, it means that you write the test first then, you write the code.

This helps you think about the class, and how it will be used. Also, by designing the test first, you are guaranteed to build a testable interface. Frequently, we will draw up a design only to discover later that such an interface is difficult, or unwieldy. Red-Green refactoring prevents this costly mistake.

Objectives
----------
- Clone the example project on bitbucket.org (https://bitbucket.org/jwright/cse394-spring2013)
- Setup Mercurial
- Create a Unit Test that fails.
- Commit the code.
- Modify the code so the test passes.
- Push to bitbucket.
- Turn in the tag URL on Blackboard

Requirements
------------
- You are to turn in 2 tags this time.
- 1 tag demonstrates the test fails (Assignment1-Red-v1).
- 1 tag demonstrates the test passes (Assignment1-Green-v1).
- The ssh repository URL

Instructions
------------
-# Follow the [video instructions](../media/Assignment1.mp4) to configure your tools and complete assignment 1.
-# Use the included [.hgrc](../media/hgrc_template) file to [configure your mercurial](../media/ConfiguringMercurial.wmv).
