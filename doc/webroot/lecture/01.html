Together we will build a blackjack simulator. It's a big enough project to sxplore a number of topics within the C++ ecosystem

- Semester Project
- Each project builds on the previous one.
- Use version control to manage source code
- Most grading is based on Unit-Tests
- Lecture
- Advanced C++ concepts and idioms

My goal is this: If I were hiring a C++ intern, or first year engineer, what skills would I need in a colleague?

If you've taken my class before a lot of the lecture will be familiar. But everyone in here has different experience. I try to fill in gaps in your experience to make you an awesome software engineer. We don't memorize C++ here, we understand it at its core so we can think in C++. We are building blackjack again this semester by we are using a top-down design approach. If you've taken this class before then we did a bottom-up design last time. This will be an interesting perspective to understand the difference. More on the project in lecture 3. So the project content will be similar, but just ask deeper questions and together we'll master the concepts that were difficult last semester.

If you have not taken my class before, please don;t drop it.

Students who turn in their work, do well in this class

I understand this class takes priority after your core classes, therefore I have very relaxed due dates. My goal is to help you be successful in your core classes and your interviews. My office hours are intended to be more of a tutorial session. You are free to bring work from 310, 340 or any other CSE course and we'll look at C++ solutions together.

I think of this week as my interview. You guys are essentially hiring me to teach you. I am interviewing for the opportunity to work with you for a semester. In that vein here is my resume. My background is in embedded software. I specialize in that application/hardware interface. 

I am also the Secretary of the Linux User's Group, so if you are interested in learning more about Linux, come to the installfest on Sept 7th.
