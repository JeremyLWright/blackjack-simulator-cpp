```haskell
main = print "I'm the language that thinks its better than you."

  A simple, in-browser, Markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:
  
- Why are tools important

- Mercurial

- How we’ll use version control here
  
  
  .footnote[.red[*] At least browsers try their best]

.left-column[
## Overview
]
.right-column[
Together we will build a blackjack simulator. It's a big enough project to sxplore a number of topics within the C++ ecosystem

- Semester Project
- Each project builds on the previous one.
- Use version control to manage source code
- Most grading is based on Unit-Tests
- Lecture
- Advanced C++ concepts and idioms
]
???
My goal is this: If I were hiring a C++ intern, or first year engineer, what skills would I need in a colleague?

If you’ve taken my class before a lot of the lecture will be familiar. But everyone in here has different experience. I try to fill in gaps in your experience to make you an awesome software engineer. We don’t memorize C++ here, we understand it at its core so we can think in C++. We are building blackjack again this semester by we are using a top-down design approach. If you’ve taken this class before then we did a bottom-up design last time. This will be an interesting perspective to understand the difference. More on the project in lecture 3. So the project content will be similar, but just ask deeper questions and together we’ll master the concepts that were difficult last semester.

If you have not taken my class before, please don’t drop it.

Students who turn in their work, do well in this class

I understand this class takes priority after your core classes, therefore I have very relaxed due dates. My goal is to help you be successful in your core classes and your interviews. My office hours are intended to be more of a tutorial session. You are free to bring work from 310, 340 or any other CSE course and we’ll look at C++ solutions together.

I think of this week as my interview. You guys are essentially hiring me to teach you. I am interviewing for the opportunity to work with you for a semester. In that vein here is my resume. My background is in embedded software. I specialize in that application/hardware interface. 

I am also the Vice President of the Linux User’s Group, so if you are interested in learning more about Linux, come to the installfest on Jan 19th ?

## Syllabus

???
As a student, what skill level do I need to be successful? If you are just starting with C++, I encourage you to come to office hours more to get extra help. I am available to help you in any way I can.

Projects will be build and compiled with C++ on general.asu.edu
Project source will be stored in bitbucket.org
Projects will be turned in as mercurial tags. Zip files will not be accepted. 
I do not recommend using Visual Studio. Visual Studio allows some code to compile that will not compile under g++. Using visual studio will only make the projects in this class, and your other cse classes harder. 

We’re going to build blackjack game. Using a top down design.

.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
### - Markdown
]
.right-column[
A Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser:

```remark
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---

# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```

.slides[
  .first[
  ### Slide 1
  This is slide 1
  ]
  .second[
  ### Slide 2
  This is slide 2
  ]
]

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:

  - A line containing three dashes constitutes a new slide
  (not a horizontal rule, `&lt;hr /&gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're not familiar with Markdown formatting.
]
---
.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
  ### - Markdown
  ### - Inside HTML
]
.right-column[
A simple HTML document is needed for hosting the styles, Markdown and the generated slides themselves:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* Slideshow styles */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <textarea id="source">
      <!-- Slideshow Markdown -->
    &lt;/textarea&gt;
    <script type="text/javascript" src="remark.js">
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var slideshow = remark.create();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You may download remark to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the [latest version](https://github.com/gnab/remark/releases) online directly.

## Of course, Markdown can only go so far.

.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Slide-Properties) of slide properties.
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
  ### - Content classes
]
.right-column[
Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

```remark
.footnote[.red.bold[*] Important footnote]
```

Resulting HTML extract:

```xml
<span class="footnote">
  <span class="red bold">*</span> Important footnote
</span>
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
  ### - Content classes
  ### - Syntax Highlighting
]
.right-column[
Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration-Options#wiki-highlighting).

Using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) fenced code blocks you can easily specify highlighting language:

.pull-left[

    ```javascript
    function add(a, b)
      return a + b
    end
    ```
]
.pull-right[

    ```ruby
    def add(a, b)
      a + b
    end
    ```
]

A number of highlighting [styles](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration-Options#wiki-highlighting) are available, including several well-known themes from different editors and IDEs.

.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
]
.right-column[
To help out with giving presentations, a presenter mode comprising the
following features is provided:

- Display of slide notes for the current slide, to help you remember
  key points

- Display of upcoming slide, to let you know what's coming

- Cloning of slideshow for viewing on extended display
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
]
.right-column[
Just like three dashes separate slides,
three question marks separate slide content from slide notes:

```
Slide 1 content

???

Slide 1 notes

---

Slide 2 content

???

Slide 2 notes
```

Slide notes are also treated as Markdown, and will be converted in the
same manner slide content is.

Pressing __P__ will toggle presenter mode.
]
???
Congratulations, you just toggled presenter mode!

Now press __P__ to toggle it back off.
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
  ### - Cloned view
]
.right-column[
Presenter mode of course makes no sense to the audience.

Creating a cloned view of your slideshow lets you:

- Move the cloned view to the extended display visible to the audience

- Put the original slideshow in presenter mode

- Navigate as usual, and the cloned view will automatically keep up with the original

Pressing __C__ will open a cloned view of the current slideshow in a new
browser window.
