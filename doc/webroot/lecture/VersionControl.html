## Overview

This class has a large focus on Tools as well as C++. 

C++ is a massive language, and the systems you can built with it are equally monolithic. Tools help us manage this complexity*

- How we'll use Version Control

Google makes their business to organize the worlds data. Google uses tools extensively. When I worked at Honeywell we had a groups who’s only job was to design tools to help the programmers complete their jobs.

Nvidia is hiring a tools engineer right now. I pulled down this posting yesterday. Tools are very important, and we are lucky that many of the tools that are used professionally, are freely available as open source projects.

I was working on a project for 430.  I like to commit at each point when I get something working. And I made a change that broke the entire application.  I accidently fat-fingered a ; at the end of my for loop.

I could have spent hours looking for the ; however I just did a diff against my base and discovered the ;.

.footnote[Remember this for the quiz]

Notice there is no direct connection between the “server” and the working copy. Everything must be passed through the repository. 

What’s really great is there is nothing special about the Repository. The Repository can be anything you want, even an email!

## Command Cheat Sheet

### Create email archive
```bash
$ hg bundle
```

### View Past History
```bash
$ hg log 
```

### Show current differences (working copy vs committed)
```bash
$ hg diff aFile
```

### Show uncommited files
```bash
$ hg status
```
