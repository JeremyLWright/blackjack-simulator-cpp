We use subrepositories to download gtest into our project.

- [Google Test](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)

- Merges well with cmake

My favorite aspect of GTest is it allows one to bring up a very simple
environment to get started, but the grows with the project offering all the
way to mock objects.

- Easy to test simple stuff

- Easy to test complex stuff

## Generic Testing Vocabulary

- Suite: a collection of tests

- Fixture: a class that helps configure an environment for multiple tests

- Test: a function or method that returns for PASS or asserts for FAIL

- Parameterization: a test that accepts input to execute the test differently

### Don't apt-get gtest

GTest is a highly templated library sensitive to
compiler options. Build it with your project.

### CamelCase
Do not use _ in test names. GTEST uses _ to name mangle your tests. You do not
want to create conflicts, the compiler error are nasty: Use camelCase

### Refactor to Fixtures
Fixtures are optional, I personally don't use them until I have 2 separate
tests with the same preamble. Then I refactor into Fixtures.

## Unit Testing Tips

### Minimize State
The less state you have the easier your program will be to test. Try to
minimize state everywhere you can. This also has the benefit of increasing the
concurrency of your program.

### Build Libraries
Build your code as a library, then link it against gtest. GTEST has it's own
main.* 

Then to make your own executable, link your library against your own main.
