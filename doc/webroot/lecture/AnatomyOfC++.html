# Anatomy of a C++ Class
[the cost of pointers]
.footnote[Jeremy Wright<br/>[CSE394 :: C++ Practicum](http://www.public.asu.edu/~jlwrigh1/)]

layout: false
## Problem Statement

- Write a Named Point Class
    - 2 floating point values: x and y
    - A name represented as a char*

.footnote[C++ has raw pointers, who touch raw hardware. This will always increase complexity]
???
---
## First Attempt
```cpp

class NamedPoint
    {
    private:
        float x;
        float y;
        char *name;

    public:
        NamedPoint (float x, float y, char *name)
        {
            this->x    = x;
            this->y    = y;
            this->name = name;
        }

        float getX()    {return x;}
        float getY()    {return y;}
        char *getName() {return name;}

        void  setX(float x)       {this->x = x;}
        void  setY(float y)       {this->y = y;}
        void  setName(char *name) {this->name = name;}
    };
```
???
This lecture is sourced from a blog about why C++ should never be used for any system, ever. 
---
## Consider

```cpp
NamedPoint makeGamePoint(float x, float y, char* roomName)
{
	return NamedPoint(x,y,roomName);
}
```
???
Remember that pointers imply ownership of the object they point to.
---
## Consider

```cpp
NamedPoint makeGamePoint(float x, float y, char* roomName)
{
	return NamedPoint(x,y,roomName);
}
```

- Who owns roomName?

- encapsulation is violated here.

???
---
## Respecting Ownership/Encapsulation
```cpp
class NamedPoint
    {
    private:
        float x;
        float y;
        char *name;

    public:
        NamedPoint (float x, float y, char *name)
        {
            this->x    = x;
            this->y    = y;
            this->name = new char[strlen(name) + 1];
            strcpy (this->name, name);        
	}

        float getX()    {return x;}
        float getY()    {return y;}
        char *getName() {return name;}

        void  setX(float x)       {this->x = x;}
        void  setY(float y)       {this->y = y;}
        void  setName(char *name) {this->name = new char[strlen(name) + 1];
                                   strcpy (this->name, name);}
    };

    ```

???
New a parts
```cpp
this->name = new char[strlen(name) + 1];
strcpy (this->name, name);        
```

Is this better?
---
.left-column[
## Encapsulation

## Better??
]
.right-column[

Consider what happens when one attempts to delete the point they created.

```cpp
…
NamedPoint* p1 = new NamedPoint(0,0, “Origin”);
…
delete p1; //What happens here?
```

Or event simplier
```cpp
void fn()
{
    NamedPoint p1(0,0, “Origin”);
} 

```

]

This trades in one set of bugs for another. The new version has the following problems:
It doesn't have a destructor, so it leaks memory.
setName() doesn't delete name, so it leaks more memory if setName() is called.
strlen(NULL) and strcpy(NULL) are bad. Usually, a program will crash if this is attempted, so we really should check for NULL.

---

## Check for NULL

```cpp
NamedPoint (float x, float y, char *name)
{
    this->x    = x;
    this->y    = y;
    if (name == NULL)
        this->name = NULL;
    else
    {
        this->name = new char[strlen(name) + 1];
        strcpy (this->name, name);
    }
}
```

## Add a destructor
```cpp
~NamedPoint ()
{
    if (name != NULL)
        delete name;
}
```

---
```cpp
class NamedPoint {
 private:
    float x;
    float y;
    char *name;
 public:
    NamedPoint (float x, float y, char *name){
    this->x    = x;
    this->y    = y;
      if (name == NULL)
        this->name = NULL;
      else{
 	this->name = 
         new char[strlen(name) + 1];
         strcpy (this->name, name);
      }
   }
   ~NamedPoint () {
      if (name != NULL)
         delete name;
    }
    ```
???
New destructor. 
New check for null in the constructor
---
```cpp
float getX() {
    return x;
}
float getY() {
    return y;
}
    
char const *getName() {
    return name;
}
void  setX(float x) {
    this->x = x;
}
void  setY(float y) {
    this->y = y;
}
    
void  setName(char *name) {
  if (this->name != NULL)                                       
      delete this->name;
  if (name == NULL)                                       
    this->name = NULL;
  else {                                     
      this->name = new            
      char[strlen(name) + 1];
      strcpy (this->name, name);
   }
 }
 ```
???
 New check for null in setname
 Null this->name is argument is null

- Named Point allocated with new[] but deletes with delete not delete[]
    - This is compiler specific and most of the time works, but its still technically wrong
    
- Testing for NULL before the delete is not necessary since the standard defines delete 0 is harmless. This is only a performance point.

- NamedPoint now trashes the heap if any NamedPoint objects are passed by value (like, for example, returning a NamedPoint object from a function). 
    - This is because the copy constructor that C++ gives us for free copies the 'name' pointer, but does not copy the contents. 
    - Now, calling the destructor on the first shared 'name' returns the memory to the heap (although the second copy will continue to use it, EVEN IF THE MEMORY GETS ALLOCATED TO SOME OTHER USE). 
    - Calling the destructor on the second shared 'name' probably corrupts the heap by deleting memory that was not, at that time, allocated (the second delete isn't required to corrupt the heap, but this is how most C++ heap managers work).
- It has similar problems with the default assignment operator.

We applied the rule of 3, and did it all right. Its a simple point class
right?

## Move Constructor
```cpp
NamedPoint(NamedPoint&& other)
{
    this.name = other.name; //Move the pointer
}
```
Move means: Steal it's guts...
### Move Assignment Operator
```cpp
NamedPoint& operator=(NamedPoint&& other)
{
    if(this != other)
    {
        delete name; //Delete my own resources
        name = NULL;

        name = other.name;
    }
