/**
 * \mainpage CSE-394 Semester Blackjack Project
 * 
 * In this class we will build a blackjack simulator. We will leverage such
 * design patterns and Observer, MVC, and Abstract Factory.
 *
 * Introduction
 * ============
 * This project is divided into 7 assignments. Each assignment contributes
 * a component to the project as a whole. By the end of the semester you should
 * be able to setup a project using the CMake build system, manage the project
 * using Mercurial Distributed Version Control, and unit test it with GTest. 
 * This project will be managed as a Test Driven design. The Tests will be given
 * to you, and this will for the basis for your grade. 
 *
 * Each week you will received a set of classes to make tests pass. Initially
 * the tests will be failing, once the code is complete the test cases will turn
 * green.  Green tests will received full credit. 
 *
 * Assignments
 * ===========
 * - \subpage assign1
 * - \subpage assign2
 * - \subpage assign3
 * - \subpage assign4
 * - \subpage assign5
 * - \subpage assign6
 * - \subpage assign7

/**
 * \page assign1 Assigment 1 - Unit Testing
 * This project is about an agile concept called Red-Green Refactoring. Essentially, it means that you write the test first then, you write the code.

This helps you think about the class, and how it will be used. Also, by designing the test first, you are guaranteed to build a testable interface. Frequently, we will draw up a design only to discover later that such an interface is difficult, or unwieldy. Red-Green refactoring prevents this costly mistake.

Objectives
----------
- Clone the example project on bitbucket.org (https://bitbucket.org/jwright/cse394-spring2013)
- Setup Mercurial
- Create a Unit Test that fails.
- Commit the code.
- Modify the code so the test passes.
- Push to bitbucket.
- Turn in the tag URL on Blackboard

Requirements
------------
- You are to turn in 2 tags this time.
- 1 tag demonstrates the test fails (Assignment1-Red-v1).
- 1 tag demonstrates the test passes (Assignment1-Green-v1).
- The ssh repository URL

Instructions
------------
1. Follow the video instructions to configure your tools and complete assignment 1.
1. Use the included .hgrc file to configure your mercurial.

/**
 * \page assign2 Assigment 2 :: Card Classes

This project will you will begin hacking the Blackjack program. The base framework and initial tests are provided in a mercurial bundle file. You will merge in this bundle to your own repository. Next, you will model the 3 card types in Blackjack. Unit Tests will be a valuable part of this project since the rest of your projects will uses these card classes extensively. Some base unit tests are provided. Your grade is based on these base tests. However the test coverage of the base project is poor, and I encourage you to write your own tests.

This base framework uses inheritance, and composition where appropriate for the design. Study when inheritance vs composition. One is not necessarily better than the other. Once we complete the base implementation, we’ll be able to script player behavior to evaluate betting strategies, using the Lua scripting language.

Objectives

* Merge in the base project bundle.

* Complete three classes: Card, FaceCard, and AceCard

* Create unit tests for methods. 100% coverage is not required, but these are core classes. The more robust they are, the easier the rest of the project will be.

* Push to bitbucket.

* Turn in the tag URL on Blackboard 
*
* | Card | Hard Value | Soft Value | Rank |
* |------|------------|------------|------|
  | Ace | 11 | 1 | 11 |
|Queen| 10 |10 |10|
|King | 10 |10 |10|
|Jack | 10 |10 |10|
|10   | 10 |10 |10|
| 9 | 9 | 9 | 9|
| 8 | 8 | 8 | 8|
| 7 | 7 | 7 | 7|
| 6 | 6 | 6 | 6|
| 5 | 5 | 5 | 5|
| 4 | 4 | 4 | 4|
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3|
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 2| 

Reference the Card Class documentation.

1. Merge in the project2.bundle (See below)

2. Implement your 3 classes.

3. All Cards tests must pass to get full credit.

4. Commit, and Tag this as: Assignment2_XX (where XX is a counter starting at 00)

Merging in Mercurial

Merging is a very common task in programming as part of a team. This project is to demonstrate how easily one can share code with another person using Mercurial. I completed the base framework of the application and created a “bundle”. A bundle is easy to make: simply type hg bundle before you type hg push and a zip archive will be created with the outgoing changes. This file is then easy to email to someone. In this scenario, I created the bundle, and I want you to merge in my changes to your own repository.

* Copy the bundle file to general.asu.edu

* On general.asu.edu, navigate to your working copy. Assure there are not any outstanding change by typing hg status.

o hg status should return with no changes.

* Merge in the project2 base project by "pulling" changes from my zip bundle

o hg pull ../project2.bundle

o hg merge

* Now commit to save the merge result.

o hg commit

* Now use cmake like you normally do.

o mkdir build #You probably already have this….

o cd build

o cmake ..

o make

* Run the unit tests

o ./unit-test

You should have a pile of failing unit tests now. Each project will be to fix a small number of them. In this project you only need to make the Card tests pass. Note this means that when you complete Project 1 some tests will still be failing; this is okay.
